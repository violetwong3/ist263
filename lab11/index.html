        I have loved to draw since I was a child. I started to do art seriously from the <strong>9th grade</strong>. I love not only the finished product but the ambiance of the smell of pencils and the sound of sharpening them with a knife and the choosing and blending of colors and materials. The process of turning lines and colors into something beautiful felt magical. Plus, whenever I see something striking - a face, a flower, a nature scene--I just want to capture it.

        In high school, I have explored different media: ink pen, colored pencil, acrylic, oil, gouache, watercolor, and even chalk pastel. It was a wonderful journey to learn about it and get better at it. During my architecture journey at Syracuse, I have learned new skills in building 3D models and making 2D drawings using Rhino, Illustrator, Photoshop, and ProCreate. I am now more skilled with digital drawings, which opened new doors for me to create and design.
